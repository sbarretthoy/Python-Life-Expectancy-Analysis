# Python-Life-Expectancy-Analysis
As a new analyst, I have conducted an open source exploratory analysis looking at life expectancy data around the world. 

# Life Expectancy Analysis Project

## Context

As someone with a background in healthcare and biology I chose a topic that could relate to my experience, but also branch out and look into data that could relate to other career paths . Public health is a very interesting topic to me, and I’ve always been intrigued to learn about the differences in our world.

## Key Questions

- Has life expectancy increased or decreased from 2000 – 2014?
- Does GDP indicate a high life expectancy?
- Does HDI indicate a high life expectancy?
- Does population effect life expectancy positively or negatively?

## Data

This data was sourced from kaggle as an open source data set originally sourced from World Health Organization.
I also sourced data from World Bank and UN Data for missing values. 

## Tools

Python was used to perform data wrangling, cleaning, subsetting and exploratory analysis. 
Python libraries were used such as pandas, numpy, os, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, folium, and json
